Example for loading Parquet files generated from sparse arff files. Aid to other OpenML devs.

## Installation
It is recommended to create a virtual environment first: `python -m venv venv`
Then activate it and install the requirements there: `source venv/bin/activate` and `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then you can start Jupyter lab and start the notebook: `jupyter-lab`.
